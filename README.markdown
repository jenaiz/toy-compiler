Toy-compiler
============

I like the idea of create a compiler, but this challenge takes more time that I currently have. When I see the tutorial of **Jack Crenshaw** I decided to create a little toy based in him tutorial.

The initial tutorial was build using Pascal, but I have decided to use Ruby. 

I hope that you enjoy the code.

Chapters
--------
The full tutorial are 16 chapters. At first I decide to create different folder but I saw that it isn't very DRY :).

The different chapters:

* **Part 1: INTRODUCTION**

* **Part 2: EXPRESSION PARSING**

* Part 3: MORE EXPRESSIONS

* Part 4 INTERPRETERS

* Part 5: CONTROL CONSTRUCTS

* Part 6: BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS

* Part 7: LEXICAL SCANNING

* Part 8: A LITTLE PHILOSOPHY

* Part 9: A TOP VIEW

* Part 10: INTRODUCING "TINY"

* Part 11: LEXICAL SCAN REVISITED

* Part 12: MISCELLANY

* Part 13: PROCEDURES

* Part 14: TYPES

* Part 15: BACK TO THE FUTURE

* Part 16: UNIT CONSTRUCTION

(Note: Chapter in bold are... done!)
